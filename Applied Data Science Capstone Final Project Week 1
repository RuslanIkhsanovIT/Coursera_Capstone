Introduction/Business Problem

For my project I have chosen city of London, UK. I loved the city, and since it is multinational and multicultural, 
problem of opening of restaurant/cafe business is tricky. 
Me and friend of mine have thought about this in area of and couldn't come to a decision of where our East cousin restaurant should have been opened.
So the business problem is - Where should we open East cousin restaurant in London, UK.
